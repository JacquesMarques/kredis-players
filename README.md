This aplication use Kredis to power a card/list view toggle for a resource’s index page, persisting the user’s view preference across requests. This tutorial will offer a gentle introduction into how Kredis works while exploring how Kredis can help us implement a common real-world UX pattern.

We will also add a bit of Turbo functionality in the form of a Turbo Frame to wrap the list of items to make applying the user’s view preference a bit more efficient.

Requiriments:

* Ruby 3.0.0+
